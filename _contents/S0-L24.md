### Towards Efficient Generative Large Language Model Serving: A Survey from Algorithms to Systems
+ https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.15234
+ In the rapidly evolving landscape of artificial intelligence (AI), generative large language models (LLMs) stand at the forefront, revolutionizing how we interact with our data. However, the computational intensity and memory consumption of deploying these models present substantial challenges in terms of serving efficiency, particularly in scenarios demanding low latency and high throughput. This survey addresses the imperative need for efficient LLM serving methodologies from a machine learning system (MLSys) research perspective, standing at the crux of advanced AI innovations and practical system optimizations. We provide in-depth analysis, covering a spectrum of solutions, ranging from cutting-edge algorithmic modifications to groundbreaking changes in system designs. The survey aims to provide a comprehensive understanding of the current state and future directions in efficient LLM serving, offering valuable insights for researchers and practitioners in overcoming the barriers of effective LLM deployment, thereby reshaping the future of AI.


### Pythia: A Suite for Analyzing Large Language Models Across Training and Scaling
+ https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.01373
+ How do large language models (LLMs) develop and evolve over the course of training? How do these patterns change as models scale? To answer these questions, we introduce \textit{Pythia}, a suite of 16 LLMs all trained on public data seen in the exact same order and ranging in size from 70M to 12B parameters. We provide public access to 154 checkpoints for each one of the 16 models, alongside tools to download and reconstruct their exact training dataloaders for further study. We intend \textit{Pythia} to facilitate research in many areas, and we present several case studies including novel results in memorization, term frequency effects on few-shot performance, and reducing gender bias. We demonstrate that this highly controlled setup can be used to yield novel insights toward LLMs and their training dynamics. Trained models, analysis code, training code, and training data can be found at \url{this https URL}.

## More Readings: 


### Langchain:
  + https://python.langchain.com/docs/get_started/introduction


### haystack.deepset.ai
+ https://github.com/deepset-ai/haystack
+ LLM orchestration framework to build customizable, production-ready LLM applications. Connect components (models, vector DBs, file converters) to pipelines or agents that can interact with your data. With advanced retrieval methods, it's best suited for building RAG, question answering, semantic search or conversational agent chatbots.




### LlamaIndex  
  + https://docs.llamaindex.ai/en/stable/
  LlamaIndex supports Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG). Instead of asking LLM to generate an answer immediately, LlamaIndex:
 retrieves information from your data sources first, / adds it to your question as context, and / asks the LLM to answer based on the enriched prompt.
